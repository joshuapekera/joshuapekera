# My Portfolio

I created this site to house my product design portfolio and future blog. It is intended to be a modern site using progressive features that are not supported by legacy browsers.

## Front Stack
It is a static site built with using Grunt-Assemble and Handlebars. I am using a smoothstate.js for HTML5 history and animated transitions between pages.
